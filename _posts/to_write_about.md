# Things I Would Love to Write About

I'm one of those (not so rare, I think) foolish, hopeful, naive delusionals who is always thinking:

“Gosh, now there’s yet another topic I should add to my list of __essays I would like to write when I find the time__. I sure do hope I find my way around to it soon, before I completely forget these dewy, mediocre sparks of spontaneous shower-genius on the subject! But before I can begin on that topic, I must finish all the other essays I’ve already begun, but which are not __quite__ yet ready for publication in **The Pantheon**, where I picture them snugly nestled between Chaucer and Confucius.”

Yes, well, because my surname ends in “C”, you see. Oh, haha, my mistake! You wanted to know why I pictured myself in The Pantheon rather than The Poubelle? Yes, I suppose you would.

This problem is quite a persistent one, so it requires a cleverly engineered solution. It seems to be the aspiration of many bloggers to __just put things out there__. I’ve always agreed with this sentiment when others have expressed it, and thought it applicable in my own context. But, for some reason, it hasn’t been sufficient to force me to **just publish**. I don't know why.

Nonetheless, I often notice that my notes are quite lengthy, often in full sentences, and very occasionally interesting (at least to me). But I'm reluctant to publish anything because each topic seems to deserve a book-length treatment (or a book series accompanied by a speaking tour). Consistent with this, I am often turned off by the brevity of Tweet threads and perfunctory blog posts, even as I acknowledge that some such short writings are masterfully concise and information-dense. I do think publication of one’s thoughts is useful, not least as a means of thinking rigorously and transparently. And of course I will do my utmost to ensure that this blog is, in the least, something I would enjoy reading.

So, I have decided to publish some writings here, promising no more than notes on things I would love — at some point far in the future but definitely not now — to write about properly. Hopefully this low bar will get me going and I can try to surpass it later.
