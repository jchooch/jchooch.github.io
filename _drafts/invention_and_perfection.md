======================================== NOTES ========================================
I'm constantly impressed by your phenomenological sensitivity and insight. I felt compelled to become a patron after watching your recent In Praise of Subtle Cinematography. I've spent some time thinking about subtle cinematography recently, but it's a hard thing to put into words. You did an amazing job. I've loved film for many years, but your essays have developed and expanded my taste in new and lasting ways, which I am sure will bring me immense joy as long as I live. For that, I'm immensely grateful! Please keep at it as long as you can. 

As one becomes more enamoured with great film, one becomes more able to appreciate older classics. Often the appeal of these films is partially historical – sometimes it is significantly historical – as they have influenced many other films or were "the first" to innovate some technique or style. But the problem is that no style is likely to have been introduced and perfected simultaneously, and so one always wonders how important "firsts" are. 

For example, historians of science may be very interested in the early microscopists or who invented the first steam engine, but such information arguably matters not one bit to the contemporary biologist or engineer. Perhaps inventors need always learn about the innovative throughout history, but I am not a filmmaker. I am a critical consumer, so what use should I have of "firsts"? It seems unlikely that many "firsts" are "bests", particularly if they are influential, so are many classic films loved significantly out of sentimentality.

======================================== THINGS TO MENTION ========================================

* Welles' Citizen Kane
* For me, the dolly zoom in Vertigo doesn't come close to being as psychologically evocative as in Jaws or as visually intriguing as in Goodfellas.
* Eyeline matching has rarely been done better than in Rear Window.
* Long takes in Rope and Birdman and 1917 and Boiling Point.

======================================== DRAFT ========================================

An exploration, drawing significantly on film, of the relative value of technical/stylistic innovation versus technical/stylistic perfection in art. 0000 words. ~0-00 mins.

Though it's a bit out of my wheelhouse, I'd like to commit to (digital) ink some thoughts and questions I've had for some time regarding _invention_ and _perfection_ in art. I'm by no means especially well-read in this area, so am writing this as much in the hope of receiving pointers to more eloquent disquisitions as anything else. Please do reach out to me on Twitter or by email if you'd like to respond or elaborate on anything I say below!

Having not read much on aesthetics and the philosophy of art, I've been struggling with a question which may be pedestrian to some, but which I think is profound nonetheless. 

Over the course of my life, I've loved film and increasingly come to appreciate films which are not only diverting, not only entertaining, but beautiful works of art. But as one becomes more enamoured with great film, one becomes more able to appreciate older classics. Often the appeal of these films is partially historical – sometimes it is significantly historical – as they have influenced many subsequent films or were "the first" to innovate some technique or style or content. But the problem is that no style is likely to have been simultaneously introduced _and_ perfected, and so one always wonders: How important should _firsts_ be to us, in the present? By firsts, I mean cases of invention. We might similarly call cases of perfection of some technique or style or content _bests_. So, the question becomes: How should we think about the relative value of firsts and bests? 

Immediately, we're in danger of a very significant diversion into the question of _What constitutes "art"?_. I will try to give my own answer to this question elsewhere and elsewhen, but will naturally and necessarily rely on my answer to that question here, parenthetically. I hope it will be evocative for me to concisely say that I believe that aesthetics is like ethics, and that the measure of the value of art is in its value _for people_ (or, more correctly, for all moral patients, whoever they may be).




- We may value firsts because they are actually cryptic bests. 
	- They are uninfluenced. They are pure. Subsequent bests are really just copies.
- Or we may value firsts because they teach us about human nature. Or the context within which a first can be innovated.
	- That historical information may be valuable. We study inventors partially to understand the source of creativity and innovation. 

- We praise inventors and discoverers in engineering and science. And so we praise them in art too. Do we do so partially because they tend to be more interesting (have more interesting personalities and stories) than perfectionists? Or is it perhaps that we find it harder to measure perfection? Perhaps it takes a special sort of perceptual hubris to claim to be able to discern perfection. But then, contrary to this, it's the pretention of critics and historians, rather than of civilians, to care disproportionately about firsts as compared to bests. So the picture is not clear.
