<span style="font-size:14px">
I recently attended the funeral of a beautiful friend taken long before his time.<br>
His family had chosen some of his favourite songs to play during the service, which I found very moving.<br>
If – God forbid – I die before my time, I can at least save my family that difficulty.<br>
In any case, this may help friends in due course or even stimulate others in the meantime.<br>

Songs I'm currently considering, in no particular order:
<ul>
	<li>Take Me to the River, Talking Heads [] (entrance music)</li>
	<li>You Only Live Once, The Strokes [3:08] (opener)</li>
	<li>One Day Like This, Elbow [6:33] (closer)</li>
	<li>Dawn Chorus, Thom Yorke [] (exit music)</li>
	<li>Instant Crush, Daft Punk & Julian Casablancas [] ()</li>
	<li>Someone New, Hozier [3:42] ()</li>
	<li>Avril 14th, Aphex Twin [] (poem/slideshow)</li>
	<li>Mookid, Aphex Twin [] (poem/slideshow)</li>
	<li>Goodbye, Stranger, Supertramp [5:48] (slideshow; cymbals after "you can laugh at my behaviour, that'll never bother me" better be accompanied by cuts between shockingly embarassing photos)</li>
	<li>Sunny, Marvin Gaye [] ()</li>
	<li>Little Person, Jon Brion [] ()</li>
	<li>Hallelujah, Jeff Buckley [] ()</li>
	<li>Armchairs, Andrew Bird</li>
	<li>Try A Little Tenderness, Otis Redding</li>
	<li>Shine On You Crazy Diamond Part II, Pink Floyd</li>
	<li>Lately, Stevie Wonder</li>
	<li>Roads, Portishead</li>
	Total time: ___ mins
	<li>Portishead?</li>
	<li>Supertramp?</li>
	<li>Nina Simone?</li>
	<li>Paolo Nutini?</li>
	<li>Van Morrison?</li>
	<li>Stevie Wonder?</li>
	<li>Elton John?</li>
	<li>David Bowie?</li>
	<li>Foals?</li>
	<li>Gang of Youths?</li>
	<li>Arctic Monkeys?</li>
	<li>Keane? (This Is The Last Time, </li>
</ul>

I'd like to use my funeral to subject an audience to a final lesson. What I've learnt. Maybe a pre-recorded video. Maybe free copies of a book. Maybe a film collage. This would be saved for before the reception, at someone's house, so money doesn't need to be wasted on the funeral parlour or wherever the main service happens.

<ol style="font-size:14px">
	<li>Hallelujah, Jeff Buckley</li>
	<li>I Like It, DeBarge (to accompany a silly video)</li>
	<li>Videotape, Radiohead (to accompany a sentimental video)</li>
	<li>Dawn Chorus, Thom Yorke</li>
</ol>
