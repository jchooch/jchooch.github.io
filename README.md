# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# Description

This is the README for the MVP personal website I will create with Vite, React, Sass, ...what else?

# Organisation

- New blogs are provided by new React page components, which files should be identified by three keywords and named as such "BlogOneTwoThree.jsx".
