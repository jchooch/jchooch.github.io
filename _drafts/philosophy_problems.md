IN PROGRESS: Profound Problems in Formal Philosophy

I find many scientifically-inclined people detract from philosophy. I think many such people think philosophy is the rubbish bin to which all ill-posed and insoluble questions are destined to be consigned, there forevermore to be debated by those naturally inclined towards speculation and needless abstraction over formal rigour and reasoning in the service of practical ends. I think this is a misapprehension (or miscommunication) and a shame!

For much the same reason that I find various topics in computer science, cognitive science, and biology profound, I find various open (perhaps insoluble) problems in formal philosophy profound. What is formal philosophy? I regard formal philosophy as all philosophical endeavour which utilises mathematics, logic, and other tools of formal science [LINK WIKIPEDIA]. The variety of formal philosophy most often described is probably formal epistemology, which is concerned with formal theories of knowledge and belief, but many other fields of philosophy benefit from formal tools, including philosophy of science (e.g. "computational philosophy"), the foundations of mathematics (e.g. work on provability), axiology (e.g. work on moral uncertainty inspired by decision theory), and many topics in linguistics and cognitive science, whose paradigm practitioners were for some time simply "philosophers", as is (correctly) said of many other disciplines, from physics to biology to economics. (For a more general discussion of the nature, uses, and interpretation of philosophy, see my discussion here. [NEED LINK])

In the hope of igniting greater appreciation for – and attention to – philosophical investigation of such problems, I thought I'd share some of my favourites here. Many of these problems have analogues and consequences across multiple philosophical subfields. I hope they stimulate you as much as they do me, and that you are struck like me by their generality and broad import (in our connected [LINK TO POST ON CONSILIENCE] world).

- Newcomblike problems and the difficulty of "causation".
- Related: the meaning of counterfactuals (all of which are true on the classical conditional formulation) (may feed into other philosophical problems like the above).
- Transformative experience and goal integrity.
- Group belief aggregation (e.g. aggregate-then-update conflicts with update-then-aggregate).
- Belief revision...?
- Goal integrity...?
- The frame problem...?
- Gavagai...?
- The problem of induction... statistical learning and AI alignment are related!
