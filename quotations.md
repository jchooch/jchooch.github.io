“The soul environs itself with friends, that it may enter into a grander self-acquaintance or solitude; and it goes alone for a season, that it may exalt its conversation or society.”<br>
– Ralph Waldo Emerson
</p>
<p>
“However beautiful the strategy, you should occasionally look at the results.”<br>
– Winston Churchill

<p>
“Or is it, that as in essence whiteness is not so much a color as the visible absence of color, and at the same time the concrete of all colors; is it for these reasons that there is such a dumb blankness, full of meaning, in a wide landscape of snows - a colorless, all-color of atheism from which we shrink?” <br>
– Herman Melville, Moby-Dick
