Quantitative Ideas in Evolutionary Theory

Hardy-Weinberg Principle
A population's allele and genotype frequencies are constant in the absence of evolutionary influences.
What constitutes an evolutionary influence?
Assumptions of HW Principle:
- No selection
- No mutation
- No migration
- Large population
- Random mating
p + q = 1 [dominant_allele_freq + recessive_allele_freq = 1]
p^2 + 2pq + q^2 = 1 [homo_dom_freq + hetero_freq + homo_recess_freq = 1]

How does the HW principle break as we break each of its assumptions?
Can we use HW for inference even when its assumptions are broken?
