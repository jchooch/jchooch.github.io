# Things which have influenced me 
## or which I'm pretty sure are great
<i><a href="https://jchooch.github.io/"> Joe Choo-Choy </a></i>
<br>
<br>
<b>N.B.</b> It's common for lists of favourites to basically just be lists of things people have consumed which weren't shit. I have tried to be selective here. I think I've consumed relatively many films, books, television shows, etc. Nonetheless, I have obviously consumed a vanishing proportion of what's out there, so the following lists are severely biased. E.g. I've never read <i>Anna Karenina</i>, but I'm pretty sure it would be listed below if I had, and I know there are many, many more examples like this. These are things which I have consumed and loved, or consumed and found affecting. This list is bound to be perpetually out-of-date, but I hope it's interesting and points people to great work. I'm sorry there are so many famous things here. One day I hope to throw out all the famous items and only include items which are unusual or with which I think people won't be familiar.
