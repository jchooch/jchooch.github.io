NOTES
- I think: art is great if, with high probability, it:
	- Grants new cognitive power to an aesthete.
	- Induces in an aesthete a profound state, such as joy or catharsis.
- And art is poor if it does these things with low probability. 
- Whether a work of art is great _for an individual_ could be said to be undefined. Rather, we might prefer to ask whether a work of art is valuable for an individual, and whether it is must be observed or decided on a case-by-case basis. Some people need to see tragedy, others comedy. Some lack understanding of the depths of human suffering, others the heights of human capability and achievement, yet others social relationships, yet others the life of animals, and on and on and on.
- We need art, perhaps, because we find discrimination easier than generation. If we can outsource generation to a film or a ballad or a novella, then perhaps we can focus on perceiving and on feeling. We can test and extend our mental models in circumstances we could not encounter in our own lives, but those model improvements can still help us in our own lives. And we can test our models with less information than we ordinarily have, or with more information, or with different information.
- Art serves to help us regularise and render consistent our understanding of the world as much as it serves to teach us new concepts or increase our sensory vocabulary.
