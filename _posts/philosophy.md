<b>In Defence of the Philosophical Mindset</b>
* Philosophy influences theoretical advances across many fields:
	- Auxiliary hypotheses (from philosophy of science to cognitive science)
	- (economics?)
	- (political science?)
	- (biology?)
	- (physics?)
	- (engineering?)
	- (mathematics?)(foundations, set theory, ...)
	- (statistics?)(decision theory, foundations, probability, ...)
	- (anthropology?)
* Philosophy births new fields:
	- 
	- Cognitive science
	- Linguistics
	- Biology
	- 
* Many great scientists have been keenly interested in philosophy
* Philosophy is not only an academic occupation
* Philosophical analysis is just good analysis
* Ethics is important
* Rationality and epistemology are important
* Lots of philosophy is rubbish, but the best stuff is outstanding
