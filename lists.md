## Things which have influenced me 
## or which I'm pretty sure are great

N.B. I would say I've consumed relatively many films, books, television shows, and so on. 
Nonetheless, I have consumed a vanishing proportion of what is out there. 
This being the case, what is listed below is significantly affected by what I have happened to sample from the world of stimuli.
These are things which I have consumed and loved, or consumed and found affecting.
This list is bound to be perpetually out-of-date, but I hope it's interesting and points people to great work.
